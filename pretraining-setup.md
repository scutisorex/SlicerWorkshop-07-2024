## Pre-training and setup!

**Hello workshop participants!**
In prep for joining the 3D Slicer/SlicerMorph workshop, you will need to do a couple things. 

**CHECK YOUR HARDWARE:**
I noted this previously, but it really helps to have a 3-button mouse for manipulating things in Slicer. I think there are a lot of computers around the museum that have them, so if you don’t have one of your own, you might be able to borrow one. If you’re gonna buy one, [here’s a cheap Amazon one](https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-3-Button-Wired-Computer-1-Pack/dp/B005EJH6RW/), but I like [this one](https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Wireless-Vertical-Ergonomic-Optical/dp/B00BIFNTMC/) a lot better.
If you can, double check that the computer you will be using has the appropriate specs for running 3DSlicer, listed [here](https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/4.8/SlicerApplication/HardwareConfiguration).

**DOWNLOAD AND INSTALL SOFTWARE:**
Slicer 5.6.2, the stable version - NOT the preview release. Download it for your OS [here](https://download.slicer.org/) and install it before the workshop. Open it to make sure you installed it correctly. It’s pretty important that you come with the program already installed so that we can jump right in to learning!
MeshLab 2023.12, which is a free, open-source, lightweight  mesh editor that will run on pretty much any computer. Download it for your OS [here](https://www.meshlab.net/#download). 

**DOWNLOAD SOME MODELS FOR EXPERIMENTATION:**
I made a Dropbox folder of a few fun items for you to play with during the workshop. If you go to the folder and download the whole thing, then unzip it, you can look at what’s in there… or you can wait and be surprised during the workshop!

You can also take a look around the [SlicerMorph github](https://github.com/SlicerMorph) and the [Slicer Discourse](https://discourse.slicer.org/). If you’re planning to use Slicer for your work moving forward, having an account on the Discourse will definitely pay off, so feel free to set that up as well.

## **A couple additional notes:**
- If you don’t have a museum badge, someone will need to sign you in. **Please tell me as soon as possible if you don’t have a badge** (students/visitors/non-museum interns/whatever). I will arrange for someone to sign you in at the West entrance when you get to the museum.
- **Lunch/snacks will NOT be provided.** Please bring your own lunch and snacks! 
- Please remember to bring the charger for your computer. It will definitely be required, especially for the all-day session.
- Don’t forget - it’s important to be there for all three days. Especially the first two days, as they will build on each other and will move at a quick pace to get lots of info in. **If there is some reason you can’t be there all three days, let me know as soon as possible.**

I’m looking forward to hanging out and learning with you! Let me know if you have any questions, and see you soon!
