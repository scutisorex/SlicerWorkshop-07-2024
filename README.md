# 3DSLICER WORKSHOP JULY 2024 

Hi everybody, and welcome to the main page for our 3DSlicer/SlicerMorph workshop! Thanks for joining me to learn about how to make this set of powerful tools work for you.

## Learning objectives:
By the end of this workshop, you will:
- Understand the basic structure of different kinds of 3D data you might work on in Slicer
- Feel comfortable with navigating the Slicer interface and be able to install, open, and update modules
- Be able to import and visualize several types of 3D data
- Know the basics of segmentation and model generation
- Know how to plan and execute a basic 3D geometric morphometrics analysis using SlicerMorph
- Understand how to expand your knowledge of Slicer moving forward, and become familiar with the many Slicer community resources

## Tentative schedule
### Day 1: July 10, 10am-4:30pm

10-11am: Welcome, setup, introduction to the course and 3D data types

11-12:30pm: Slicer basics and segmentation (see tutorials here)

12:30-1:30pm: Lunchtime!

1:30pm-3pm: Continued segmentation and visualization

3-4:30pm: Markups module practice and GM discussion

### Day 2: July 11, 9am-12pm

9-11:30am: Geometric morphometrics full workflow, ALPACA module if time

11:30am-12pm: Wrap up, discuss additional Slicer resources, talk about plan and responsibilities for Day 3

### Day 3: July 19, 9am-12pm

9am-12pm: TBA, based on what people want to learn after the first two days!
